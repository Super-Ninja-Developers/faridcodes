When you grow up in Argentina, you learn that ambition isn't just about setting goalsâ€”it's about challenging the status quo. As we enter 2025, I'm sharing my roadmap for the year ahead, combining my roles as a tech entrepreneur, family man, and proud Argentine.

## The Power of Ambitious Goals

There's something uniquely Argentine about setting seemingly impossible goals. Maybe it's in our DNA, or maybe it's because we've seen our sports icons and entrepreneurs defy expectations time and again. Whatever the reason, here's my ambitious blueprint for 2025.

## Family Adventures Meet Tech Life

My first major goal is taking my family on a European adventure. But this isn't just about tourismâ€”it's about proving that you can build a successful tech company while prioritizing family experiences. We're turning Europe into our temporary home, combining work with exploration.

## Embracing the Digital Nomad Reality

2025 is the year I'm going full digital nomad. As CTO of a growing healthtech company, I'm determined to show that location independence isn't just a Silicon Valley privilege. Argentine tech talent can lead global teams from anywhere in the world.

## Scaling Impact in Healthcare

Speaking of my role at Ãœma Salud, our goal is to double our company's size in 2025. This isn't just about numbersâ€”it's about expanding access to healthcare across Latin America through technology. We're proving that innovation in healthcare can come from anywhere, even from a startup born in Argentina.

## Bridging Tradition with Innovation

One of my most personal projects for 2025 is automating traditional horticulture practices. This combines my mother's gardening wisdom with modern automation technology. It's about honoring our agricultural heritage while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

## The SaaS Challenge

Here's where it gets interesting: I'm committing to building 6 SaaS products in 12 months. With current AI capabilities, what used to take a year can now be accomplished in weeks. This isn't just about building productsâ€”it's about challenging traditional development timelines and showing what's possible.

## The Soul Project

Finally, because life isn't all about code and startups, I'm learning to play Piazzolla's "AdiÃ³s Nonino" on the bandoneon. Why? Because sometimes the most meaningful innovations happen when we connect different parts of our lives. Besides, have you ever tried debugging while listening to tango? It's a game-changer.

## Why Share These Goals?
Some might say these goals are too ambitious. But as we say in Argentina, "El que no arriesga, no gana" (Who doesn't risk, doesn't win). I'm sharing these goals publicly not just for accountability, but to inspire others in the tech community to dream bigger.

What's more, I'm committed to making most of my 2025 projects, including this blog, open source. Why? Because true innovation shouldn't be locked behind closed doors. My ambition isn't to get rich from these projectsâ€”it's to inspire others to start their own entrepreneurial journey, to demonstrate how technology can dramatically improve our world, and to show that we can tackle projects without selfishly compartmentalizing knowledge.

Think about it: how many great ideas never saw the light of day because someone felt they didn't have access to the right knowledge or resources? How many potential solutions to real problems are sitting in private repositories, never to be improved upon by the community? That's not the kind of tech world I want to build.

By making my projects open source, I'm not just sharing codeâ€”I'm sharing possibilities. Every line of code, every architecture decision, every solved problem becomes a building block for someone else's innovation. Whether you're a student in Buenos Aires, a developer in Bangalore, or a startup founder in Lagos, you'll have access to not just the end product, but the entire journey of building these solutions.

As Isaac Asimov said: "El conocimiento es el Ãºnico bien que crece cuando se comparte" (Knowledge is the only good that grows when shared). And as Isaac Newton once said, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"â€”acknowledging that all our knowledge is built upon the foundations laid by our predecessors. It would be unfair to the world to withhold my knowledge when I have benefited so much from those who came before me. In 2025, I'm putting this philosophy into action.

## The Road Ahead

Will all these goals be achieved exactly as planned? Maybe not. But that's not the point. The point is setting ambitious targets that push us to grow, innovate, and maintain our cultural identity while building in the global tech space.

As we like to say in the startup world: if your goals don't scare you a little, they're probably not big enough. And if there's something we Argentines know how to do, it's dreaming big while keeping our feet on the ground (usually with a mate in hand ðŸ§‰).

Here's to 2025â€”may it be a year of bold innovations, meaningful connections, and perhaps a few well-played tangos.
