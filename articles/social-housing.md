Back in 2017, I had the privilege of conducting a fascinating research project alongside my colleagues Rocío Drabenche and Nayla Bosch, which we presented at the ALAS Congress. Our study focused on exploring middle-class perceptions of social housing and urban rights - a topic that remains highly relevant in today's discussions about inclusive cities.

As a sociologist passionate about both technology and social impact, this research particularly interested me because it revealed how deeply embedded neoliberal spatial logic is in urban imaginaries. Our qualitative study, based on 12 semi-structured interviews with middle-class adults, uncovered three predominant discourses that shape how people think about social housing.

## Key Findings

What we found was quite revealing: while all interviewees acknowledged housing deficit as a problem, most believed that building social housing in their neighborhoods would decrease their property values. This wasn't just about economics - it reflected deeper perceptions about who "deserves" to live in certain urban spaces.

One of our most interesting findings - which I still use today in my current work combining sociology and tech - was how the prevailing image of social housing as "tower blocks" served as an implicit justification for opposing its construction in central areas. This mental model persists despite the existence of numerous alternative architectural approaches.

## Three Key Discursive Frameworks

Through our analysis, we identified three key discursive frameworks:

1. The "urbanist" discourse - heavily influenced by neoliberal spatial logic
2. The "ecological/environmentalist" discourse - suggesting peripheral locations for social housing
3. The "social/integrationist" discourse - defending the right to urban space

## Impact on Current Work

Looking back at this research today, as I work on technology projects with social impact, I'm struck by how many of our findings remain relevant. The way social perceptions shape urban policy continues to be a critical factor in building more inclusive cities.

These insights have deeply influenced my current work at ÜMA Health and other open-source projects. Understanding how social narratives shape policy outcomes has been invaluable in developing technological solutions that truly serve all segments of society.

## Ongoing Questions

The questions we raised then still resonate today:

- Are cities really "overcrowded," or is this a constructed perception?
- Can we reimagine social housing beyond traditional models?
- What does the right to the city mean in practice?

## From Research to Practice

This research experience strongly shaped my approach to combining sociological insights with technological innovation. It taught me that effective solutions must address both material conditions and social perceptions - a principle I apply daily in my current work developing health tech solutions.

Our findings were not just academic - they highlighted how social perceptions can act as barriers to more inclusive housing policies. This understanding continues to inform my work in creating technology that bridges social gaps rather than reinforcing them.

## Looking Forward

I'm sharing this today because I believe these insights remain crucial for anyone working at the intersection of social impact and technology. Whether we're developing AI solutions, healthcare platforms, or urban policies, understanding these deep-seated social perceptions is key to creating truly inclusive solutions.

The complete study goes into much more detail about our methodology and findings, but I hope this overview gives you a sense of why this research was - and remains - significant for urban development and social inclusion efforts.

What are your thoughts on how we might better integrate social housing into urban spaces while addressing these perceptual barriers? I'd love to hear your perspectives on this continuing challenge.
